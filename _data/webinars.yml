    Agriculture is the most important resource of food production for human beings and accounts for more than 26% of the global workforce. 
    As the world population continues to grow and the agricultural workforce declines the demand for more efficient agricultural and ecological monitoring
    techniques is on the upswing. This webinar will shed light on the uses of machine learning in agriculture.

    Tackling climate change is costly, but letting greenhouse gas emissions grow unchecked is even more expensive. 
    The Social Cost of Carbon, or “SCC”, allows us to assess this tradeoff by measuring the monetized damages 
    associated with the release of one ton of CO2. The SCC plays a central role in determining the nature and 
    stringency of climate policy both in the US and abroad, but existing estimates rely on extremely outdated 
    scientific evidence. In this webinar, we will discuss what is needed to bring the SCC back to the scientific
    frontier, focusing on the importance of big data and data science tools in a modern SCC framework.

    Climate change mitigation requires substantial investment, technology
    development and political effort. However, this large-scale task cannot
    be accomplished without considering important ethical and social
    considerations. Climate change mitigation should be accomplished in such
    a way that historically marginalized and vulnerable groups across the
    world have equitable access to mitigation technologies, financial
    incentives, and social rewards. How can this goal be achieved? Is data
    science and AI useful for this purpose? In this webinar, we will learn
    from the panelists in industry and academia and will aim to identify
    challenges and opportunities for AI in this field.

    defects in solar cells and their impact on electrical conversion
    efficiency. During his studies at MIT, he took a summer off and worked in
    Mexico's Secretaría de Energía (Energy Secretariat). As a postdoc (and
    later as a Professional Researcher) at UC Berkeley, he began studying
    energy systems and equitable renewable energy integration mechanisms in
